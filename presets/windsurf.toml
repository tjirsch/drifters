# Windsurf IDE Configuration Preset
#
# Windsurf is Codeium's AI-powered code editor with agentic coding capabilities.
# This preset syncs Windsurf configuration and rules.
#
# What gets synced:
# - Windsurf user configuration from .codeium/windsurf/
# - User settings and preferences
# - Custom rules and configurations
#
# What gets excluded:
# - Cache and temporary files
# - Logs and debug data
# - Session-specific data
# - Workspace-specific rules (kept local per project)
#
# Note: Windsurf uses the .codeium directory structure.
# Workspace-specific rules in .windsurf/rules are intentionally excluded
# as they're project-specific and typically committed to the project repo.
#
# Usage:
#   drifters import-app windsurf --file presets/windsurf.toml
#   drifters push windsurf

[apps.windsurf]
# Cross-platform paths (Windsurf uses consistent paths across OS)
