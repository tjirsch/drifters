# Cursor IDE Configuration Preset
#
# Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on VS Code.
# This preset syncs user settings, keybindings, and snippets.
#
# What gets synced:
# - settings.json - All user preferences
# - keybindings.json - Custom keyboard shortcuts
# - snippets/ - User-defined code snippets
#
# What gets excluded:
# - SQLite database files (state.vscdb) - contains some settings but is binary
# - Workspace-specific data
# - Extension storage and caches
# - Temporary files and logs
#
# Note: Cursor stores some settings in a SQLite database (state.vscdb).
# This preset focuses on JSON configuration files which are easier to sync.
# Some Cursor-specific settings may not sync via this method.
#
# Usage:
#   drifters import-app cursor --file presets/cursor.toml
#   drifters push cursor

[apps.cursor]
# Cross-platform base configuration (rarely used since Cursor is OS-specific)
